# Tutorial Tuna's Tome of Terrors
A major expansion to the UESRPG d100 system by TutorialTuna. New statblocks, traits, powers, and talents. Playable Vampirism and Lycanthropy included!

Many of the statblocks have little and missing biographies for lore and loot. If you're a TES enthusiast, I highly recommend getting in touch with us over at the lively UESRPG discord: https://discord.gg/qSfAwmpsAx

I am happy to add any lore friendly biographies of creatures and mention you as a contributor.
